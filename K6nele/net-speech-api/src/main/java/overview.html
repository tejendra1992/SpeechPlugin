<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Net Speech API is a Java API for the web-based Estonian speech recognition services
that are provided by the Laboratory of Phonetics and Speech Technology at
the Institute of Cybernetics at the Tallinn University of Technology.
This API is meant to be used in every Java program that wants to communicate
with these services, e.g. Android apps, Java applets for web browsers,
Java desktop applications.</p>

<p>Note: this API is work in progress</p>

<h2>Online services</h2>

<p>In principle there are two types of speech recognition services, with the
following features:</p>

<h3>Type 1 ("realtime")</h3>

<ul>
<li>Short input</li>
<li>Input often expected to conform to a restricted grammar
(e.g. calculator language, list of words)</li>
<li>Transcription possibly immediately "executed" by the receiving application
(added to calender, computed by the calculator, etc.)</li>
<li>One speaker</li>
<li>Immediate response (not more than a couple of seconds delay)</li>
<li>Several matches are returned with confidence scores</li>
<li>Simple transcription format: set of <em>(string, conf. score)</em> pairs</li>
</ul>

<p>Example: Google speech recognition server used by Chrome 11.</p>


<h3>Type 2</h3>

<ul>
<li>Large input (e.g. an hour of audio, e.g. podcasts)</li>
<li>Completely free-form input (maybe containing even non-speech, e.g. music)</li>
<li>Multiple speakers</li>
<li>Transcription takes longer to complete</li>
<li>Possibly higher quality transcription than with "realtime"
(e.g. possibly human-powered transcription)</li>
<li>Rich transcription format (identifies paragraphs, speakers,
pauses, music, changes of topic)</li>
</ul>


<h2>Components</h2>

<h3>Constants</h3>

<p>Various numbers and strings that denote the default service URLs,
default input parameters, supported file types,
supported parameters, error codes, etc.</p>

<h3>Low-level interfaces</h3>

<p>Public low-level interfaces for communicating with the
speech recognition services, e.g.</p>

<pre>
String id = uploadAudio(File file, Settings...) throws IOException
Document transcription = downloadTranscription(String id) throws IOException
List&lt;String&gt; matches = recognize(byte[] audio, Settings...) throws IOException
</pre>


<h3>High-level interfaces</h3>

<p>High-level interfaces that combine the lower level interfaces
for the common use cases, e.g. polling the server with a given
frequency for the given time.</p>


<h3>Service response handling</h3>

<p>The low-level methods return highly structured data in XML (or JSON).
The users need to interpret these XML documents to extract certain content:
speaker information, sync points, recognition matches and confidence values, etc.
The classes and methods in this category help with that.</p>


<h3>Management of transcriptions</h3>

<p>Given a set of transcriptions, one needs help managing them.
Transcriptions can be related to each other e.g. by sharing speakers.
One would then like to manage the speakers independently: assign them names
and real world identities.</p>


<h3>Grammar management</h3>

<p>Speech recognition can be supported by grammars, which both exclude certain
transcriptions and normalize accepted transcriptions. While the grammar is
usually applied during the recognition for better quality, it could
also be applied on the proposed alternative transcriptions,
e.g. to select a single one.</p>

<p>This API helps with uploading grammars to the services and
with applying the grammars on the client side.</p>

<h4>Examples of simple but useful grammars</h4>

<ul>
<li>Simple calculator grammar (e.g. recognizes expressions such
as "-1 - 2 / 3 + 4 * 1.3"). See also

<li>Grammar to recognize/normalize shopping list items ("3 kilo soola", "5 kotti ecuadori banaane") where
first comes quantify (as a number), then follows the unit (as a single word in partitive, e.g. "kilogrammi"),
and finally a short list of unconstrained words (the whole phrase being in partitive).
This grammar should map "numbers by words" to "numbers by digits" ("sada neliteist koma viis" &rarr; "114.5"),
and shorten the unit symbols ("milliliitrit" &rarr; "ml").</li>

<li>Grammar to recognize/normalize placenames, e.g. a placename like "veitsenbergi kolgendyheksa tallinn"
could be mapped to "A. Weizenbergi 39, Tallinn", so that it becomes searchable in mapping
applications.</li>

<li>Grammar to recognize/normalize dates and times ("reede hommikul kell kuus"), to be
used in calender applications.</li>

<li>Grammar to perform certain actions, e.g. "helista emale", "pane Ã¤ratus kella kuueks".</li>
</ul>
